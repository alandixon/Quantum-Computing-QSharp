# Quantum Computing with Q#

This is my repo for learning QC with Q#.

In April 2021, I [took part](https://github.com/alandixon/qchack-microsoft-challenge) in the [Quantum Coalition Hack](https://www.quantumcoalition.io/), which immediately showed me that I knew next to nothing about [Quantum Computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing), so I looked around for resources to learn the basics of QC with Q#.

I couldn't find what I wanted, apart from [a set of articles](https://www.strathweb.com/category/quantum-computing/) on https://www.strathweb.com/.

The plan is to follow through the articles, starting with [Introduction to quantum computing with Q# â€“ Part 1, The background and the qubit](https://www.strathweb.com/2020/03/intro-to-quantum-computing-with-q-part-1-the-background-and-the-qubit/) and code up the examples here in `src/QuantumLearning/StrathWeb`

The articles recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) but I'm going to use [VS2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) as I'm very familiar with it.

For each article, I'll put in my notes and any gotchas I found.

Also, my [Quantum Glossary](https://github.com/alandixon/Quantum-Computing-QSharp/blob/main/QuantumGlossary.md) may help ...

For editing Markdown. I used to use this [markdown editor](https://github.com/madskristensen/MarkdownEditor) which [installs as a VS2019 extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MadsKristensen.MarkdownEditor), but I started using [Typora](https://typora.io/) and I'm convinced.
