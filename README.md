# Quantum Computing with Q#

This is my repo for learning QC with Q#.

In April 2021, I [took part](docs/alan_dixon.pdf) in the [Quantum Coalition Hack](https://www.quantumcoalition.io/), which [immediately showed me](https://github.com/alandixon/qchack-microsoft-challenge) that I knew next to nothing about [Quantum Computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing), so I looked around for resources to learn the basics of QC with Q#.

I couldn't find what I wanted, apart from [a set of articles](https://www.strathweb.com/category/quantum-computing/) on https://www.strathweb.com/.

The plan is to follow through the articles, starting with [Introduction to quantum computing with Q# â€“ Part 1, The background and the qubit](https://www.strathweb.com/2020/03/intro-to-quantum-computing-with-q-part-1-the-background-and-the-qubit/) and code up the examples here in `src/QuantumLearning/StrathWeb`

The articles recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) but I'm going to use [VS2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) as I'm very familiar with it.

For each article, I'll put in my notes and any gotchas I found.

Also, my [Quantum Glossary](https://github.com/alandixon/Quantum-Computing-QSharp/blob/main/QuantumGlossary.md) may help ...

[Part 1 - Intro,  background and the qubit](docs/Part%201%20-%20Intro%2C%20%20background%20and%20the%20qubit.md)

At the end of this first part, I realised I needed more background and I looked around for suitable material.

The first thing I came up with was [Quantum Computing for Computer Scientists](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/video/quantum-computing-computer-scientists/) with a [Youtube video](https://youtu.be/F_Riqjdh2oM), all from Microsoft Research. It's basic, takes about 90 minutes without stopping, but is good as a starting point. I also found [the slides in a PDF](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2018/05/40655.compressed.pdf) and [Alan Tatourian's notes on the course](https://tatourian.blog/2018/09/01/quantum-computing-for-computer-scientists/). The slides will give you an idea of whether you need this.

For editing Markdown. I used to use this [markdown editor](https://github.com/madskristensen/MarkdownEditor) which [installs as a VS2019 extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MadsKristensen.MarkdownEditor), but I started using [Typora](https://typora.io/) and I'm convinced.
