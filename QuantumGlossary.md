| Bloch sphere      | A geometrical  representation of the pure state space of a two-level quantum mechanical  system (qubit). Values may be complex; this is reduced to the the unit circle when we only use real numbers. | https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloch_sphere      |

| CNOT gate         | Conditional NOT. Also see Toffoli gate.                      |                                                 |

| Oracle            | Black box. x ->  f(x) via black box [f]. We know nothing about [f] and can only investigate by  giving it values of x |                                                 |

| Toffoli gate      | (also CCNOT gate),  invented by Tommaso Toffoli, is a universal reversible logic gate, which  means that any reversible circuit can be constructed from Toffoli gates. Also see CNOT gate. | https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toffoli_gate      |
